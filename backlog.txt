# break down the core module [story points: 2]
The core module needs to be broken down
                priority  done (0-10)
 - autocomplete 2         0
 - block        1         10
 - crud         1         10
 - node         1         6
 - node_file    3         4
 - node_image   4         4
 - node_term    4         0
 - user         1         4

# (system) implement module dependencies [story points: 2]
Allows modules to declare dependencies to other modules and implement it

# (system) user login and security [story points: 2]
Usage of md5 should be avoided. Better to look at a sha algorithms to store the
 user password.

# (node_file) file upload [story points: 5]
The jquery file upload plugin should be integrated with the NodeFile component.
Files should be properly linked to their node.
 - As even on node creation we have a node id (temporary nodes) we can always
   associate a file with its node.
 - File virtual name should be worked out from the file name and be editable by
   the user. Ideally, we have some textboxes displayed on the file upload plugin
   for editing the file name?

# (autocomplete) implement autocomplete for users and nodes [story points 3]
This module must be implemented. A autocomplete widget should be also provided.

# (user) reset password functionality [story points 3]
Implement the reset pssword functionality - link to reset password should be
 sent via email.
