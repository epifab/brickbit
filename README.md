# BrickBit

BrickBit is an open source, object-oriented, model-view-controller PHP framework and CMS.

The very first BrickBit version was developed in Java in 2010 as part of my greaduate thesis.

Originally it had nothing to do with a CMS or PHP framework.
The original software worked as a sort of compiler.
In fact its main task was to generate source code by parsing and analysing a so called "application description file",
basically an XML file used to describe application data, logic and presentation layers.

The software was designed to be extended (by developing new plugins) in order to produce different codes for different platforms,
either web or desktop based such as JavaSwing or PHP. One of the first plugins was a PHP code generator whose target applications
were object-oriented and model-view-controller driven.

BrickBit was born a couple of years later by gradually extending and improving one of those applications.

Some features:
- Object Oriented
- Event Driven
- Model View Controller / Front Controller design pattern
- Routing
- Object Relational Mapping
- Modular
- Themes and PHP templates
- AJAX support
- Multilingual support
